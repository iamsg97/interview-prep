/**
 * Represents an action that can either create or cancel a reservation.
 *
 * - `CREATE_RESERVATION`: Used to create a new reservation with a specific id and name.
 * - `CANCEL_RESERVATION`: Used to cancel an existing reservation with a specific id.
 *
 * The `Action` type is a union type that can be one of the following:
 * - An object with `type` set to `'CREATE_RESERVATION'` and a `payload` containing an `id` (numeric) and a `name` (string).
 * - An object with `type` set to `'CANCEL_RESERVATION'` and a `payload` containing an `id` (numeric).
 *
 * Note: "action" type should be a discriminated union with specific action shapesâ€”this gives you safety, autocomplete, and no room for typos.
